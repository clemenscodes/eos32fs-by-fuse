# disk.part -- disk partitioning file
#

# The first line of this file (apart from empty or comment
# lines) must be the file name of the master boot block (or
# the string -noboot- if the disk doesn't need to be bootable).

#./mbootblk
-noboot-

# The rest of this file consists of partition table entries,
# one per line. Each entry is in the following form:
#
# partition boot type start last description
#
# partition:
#   possible values 0..14
#   indicates partition number
#   different entries need not be sorted in any way
#   no two entries may have the same partition number
# boot:
#   '*' means that the partition can be booted
#   leave this blank if the partition cannot be booted
#   more than one partition may be bootable
# type:
#   possible values 0..0x7FFFFFFF
#   indicates partition type
#   0x0000 = partition table entry not used
#   0x0058 = EOS32 file system partition
#   0x0059 = EOS32 swap space partition
#   0x0082 = Linux swap space partition
#   0x0083 = Linux file system partition
#   0x00A9 = NetBSD partition
# start:
#   sector number where partition starts (0-based)
#   no partition may start below sector 32
# last:
#   last sector of partition (0-based)
#   partitions must not overlap
# description:
#   max. 20 characters (includes trailing 0)
#   this may be displayed during bootstrap
#
# The following example exactly fits on a 900 MB disk:

0  *  0x0058       32   122879  "EOS32 root"
1     0x0059   122880   225279  "EOS32 swap"
2     0x0058   225280   430079  "EOS32 usr"
3     0x0058   430080   593919  "EOS32 home"
4  *  0x00A9   593920  1105919  "NetBSD"
5  *  0x0083  1105920  1126399  "Linux boot"
6     0x0083  1126400  1740799  "Linux root"
7     0x0082  1740800  1843199  "Linux swap"
